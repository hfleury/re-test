## Folder Structure

This project folder structure follows a **Layered Structure**.

### Layered Structure
In this approach, the application is organized into distinct layers: `handlers` (or controllers), `services`, `repositories`, and `models`. Each layer is responsible for a specific concern, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.

ðŸ“š Inspired by this [Medium article on Go project folder structures](https://medium.com/@smart_byte_labs/organize-like-a-pro-a-simple-guide-to-go-project-folder-structures-e85e9c1769c2).
